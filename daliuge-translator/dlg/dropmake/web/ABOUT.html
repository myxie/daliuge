<div class="about">
The DALiuGE Translator is a component of the <a href="https://daliuge.readthedocs.io">DALiuGE</a> system. It takes input from the <a href="https://eagle-dlg.readthedocs.io">EAGLE</a> workflow graph editor and transforms that into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for execution in the DALiuGE execution engine. In addition to just translating the graph, it also contains functionality to partition and optimally statically schedule the DAG for the deployment onto a compute cluster. More information can be found in the <a href="https://daliuge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graphs.html#translation">translator section</a> of the DALiuGE documentation.
