<div class="about">
The DALiuGE execution engine is a component of the <a href="https://daliuge.readthedocs.io">DALiuGE</a> system. It takes input produced by the DALiuGE translator in the form of a JSON formatted directed acyclic graph (DAG). The engine itself is typically deployed on a compute cluster and provides RESTful interfaces as well as a CLI. More information can be found in the <a href="https://daliuge.readthedocs.io/">the DALiuGE documentation</a>.
